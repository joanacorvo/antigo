                    <p>Inspired by otto e mezzo, a film by Federico Fellini, four different characters were created and
                        explored creatively through an immersive and interactive online experience. The website is
                        divided into two sections: the main page (with more information about the project); and the
                        interactive fiction itself.

                        user is taken through a hypothetical first day of a new job and has to complete
                        their tasks. Depending on their choices, the user would be inserted into one of five
                        groups, where, once the results are in, they could explore the possible job titles in
                        that area.

                        Based on the concept of pen-pals, the main goal is to send what has been called

                        is a risk that the others could turn against you.
                        This digital animation is a reflexion of that futuristic world, placed in the year 3018,
                        showing how the society works with a touch of irony, also brought by the background music.</p>

                    <p>In order to highlight the expression of the futuristic manifestos, the phrase written
                        by Tristan Tzara on the Dada Manifesto emphasizes that the written meaning is
                        not always what it appears to be. This composition is interpreted as using a set of
                        letters, both in repetition, that make them stop looking like words and more like
                        sounds, with the black stripes that hide part of them (as if it were the meaning) and
                        also with the M / W comparison that shows that not everything is what it seems.</p>
