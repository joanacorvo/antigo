            <h2>Competences</h2>
            <p>I consider myself a problem-solver and someone who is always looking forward to learn new things. I find the combination between creative work and technology to be my sweet spot!</p>
            <p>I have had the opportunity to learn how to work with different techniques and softwares, such as Adobe
                Creative Cloud and Figma, and in different areas of design and art, such as editorial, graphic,
                interaction, illustration, animation, and many others. </p>
            <p>Even without professional experience, I have had the opportunity to work following the same professional
                structure during my post-graduate studies. I have a grasp of how a project runs, the multiple steps to
                go through to develop a product, both from scratch and from an already existing platform. I have also
                learnt how to create a Design Systems, Wireframes, Prototypes and more.

                        them to have a better access to the information needed. The main and most important changes were
                        the implementation of a megamenu and placing important information on the pages, instead of PDF
                        files.</p>

                    <p>In a way to learn how Design Systems are made and how to use them, I was proposed to make an
                        Interface for a product and make a design system from scratch for it and adapt it to both
                        desktop and mobile screens. Cheer Brew is a coffee brand which promises to make people feel
                        better by drinking its coffee. “When your mind is wandering, or just plain bored, coffee can be
                        your friend. If you are feeling down, or just want to get fresh air, try this: go ahead and pour
                        yourself a cup of coffee.”

                        through a hypothetical first day of a new job and has to complete their tasks. Depending on
                        their choices, the user would be inserted into one of five groups, where, once the results are
                        in, they could explore the possible job titles in that area.</p>

                    <p>ATTACH is an application that seeks to connect artists from around the world. Based on the
                        concept of pen-pals, the main goal is to send what has been called package to another artist so
                        that you can share knowledge and/or work.</p>

                    <h3>Amsterdam Identity</h3>
                    <p>Study and development of Amsterdam's identity. Amsterdam is a city of not only good times, but
                        also of culture; it is a city that is in rapid adaptation and is evolving to be one of the best
                        places to live and to grow a startup.</p>

                    <h3>3018 Geophysical Map</h3>
                    <p>Imagine a world where there is no free will, where everyone is the same and do the same things.
                        When you are the only one who is concious of their choices, there is a risk that the others
                        could turn against you. This digital animation is a reflexion of that futuristic world, placed
                        in the year 3018, showing how the society works with a touch of irony, also brought by the
                        background music.</p>

                    <h3>“Must we no longer believe in words?”</h3>
                    <p>In order to highlight the expression of the futuristic manifestos, the phrase written by Tristan
                        Tzara on the Dada Manifesto emphasizes that the written meaning is not always what it appears to
                        be. This composition is interpreted as using a set of letters, both in repetition, that make
                        them stop looking like words and more like sounds, with the black stripes that hide part of them
                        (as if it were the meaning) and also with the M / W comparison that shows that not everything is
                        what it seems.</p>
